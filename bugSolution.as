The corrected ActionScript 3 code includes explicit null checks before accessing any properties:

```actionscript
var myObject:Object = someFunctionThatMightReturnNull();
if (myObject != null) {
  var myValue:String = myObject.someProperty;
} else {
  // Handle the case where myObject is null
  trace("myObject is null");
  var myValue:String = ""; // or some default value
}
```

For nested objects, chain null checks:

```actionscript
var myObject:Object = someFunctionThatMightReturnNull();
var myValue:String = "";
if (myObject != null && myObject.nestedObject != null) {
  myValue = myObject.nestedObject.someProperty;
}
```

This approach ensures that the code gracefully handles situations where objects might be null, preventing `NullPointerExceptions` and making your application more robust.
